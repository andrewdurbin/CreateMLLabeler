This is a simple/rough app which asks for a directory of images, 
allows rectangle annotations to be made with labels, and then writes those
labels/annotations with correct coordinates to an annotations.json
file in the format expected by 'Create ML'.  The name was merely pulled from a hat, and can be changed if it steps on anyone's toes.

The main goal in development of this app was to learn and show some level of understanding in the Swift language and SwiftUI framework.

Current Limitations: only builds against the 'Mac Catalyst' target
